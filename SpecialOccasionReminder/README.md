# ButtonClickComponent

My app name is "Special Occasion Remainder". I have given two buttons, one to import events from social network and other to add events manually. Import from social network button redirects to second page which have options import from facebook, google. In adding an event manually, I have written code to open a calendar to choose a date. After choosing the date, I have created fields to accept user input through text field and drop down. Need to add facebook and google API's.
